### Classification of Pigmented Skin Lesions

In this project images of common pigmented skin lesions are classified in either
**benign** or **cancerous**. Different deep neural network architectures are used both with and without transfer learned weights.

For this purpose the "HAM10000 dataset, a large collection of multi-source dermatoscopic images of common pigmented skin lesions" is be used.

This dataset consists of 10015 dermatoscopic images which can serve as a training set for academic machine learning purposes.
